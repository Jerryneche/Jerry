I don't pray for blessings. It's fruitless. I pray for the wisdom and strength to handle the blessings already given to me. I won't receive if I'm not ready. There are a plethora of blessings. The amount of blessings I get isn't based on God's capacity to give, but my capacity to receive.

There are blessings I can't reach. Yet. I'll need to grow to reach them. Literally and figuratively. That's why I'm heavy on self development. Been one hell of a ride so far.
